          <p>Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.</p>
          Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.</p>
          <p><b>What is continuous integration?</b></p>
          <p> <b>Continuous Integration</b> is a development practice that requires developers to regularly integrate code into a shared repository.</p>
          <p>This concept was intended to address the problem of later detection of issues in the build life cycle.</p>
          <p>Continuous Integration requires developers to build frequently.</p>
          <p>The usual practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should run.</p>
